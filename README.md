# square-game-js
An interactive square game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features four connected squares with unique click actions: one generates a random number, one toggles between red, blue, and green, one produces a random color, and one applies a random color to the other three squares.

# Project Description
This interactive Square Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application consists of four interconnected squares, each performing a unique action when clicked.
Square 1 serves as the central square.
Square 2 changes its color dynamically between red, blue, and green on each click.
Square 3 generates a random color every time it is clicked.
Square 4 generates a random color and applies it to the remaining three squares simultaneously.
Square 1 displays a random number when clicked.

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, random number generation, and dynamic style updates.
